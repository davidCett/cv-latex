\begin{cvparagraph}
\hspace{8mm} As a self-taught and highly curious software developer, I am driven by a passion for
continuous learning and coding challenges. My technical skills have been improved
through years of self-study and hands-on experience, allowing me to quickly adapt to
new technologies. In addition, as a former semi-professional volleyball player, I consider
the values of collaboration, dedication and reliability as key factors for a successful
team. Passionate about cooking and outdoors.
